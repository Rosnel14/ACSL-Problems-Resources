# ACSL Practice Problems & Resources


The ACSL Compeititon is divided into two sections: the short problems section and the programming section. Resources and practice problems for both are included in this repository.

The ACSL competition is also divided into three divisions: intermediate, junior, and senior. Most practice problems are labelled with a division. I recommend you start with the division you are placed in, but you can always do other division's problems as well.

All files are in PDF format so they can be viewed on any platform.

## ACSL Competition Information

This section contains detailed documents on how the ACSL competition works. 

## Short Problems Section

Files inside "Short Problem Practice" are organized by competition. Each competition tests different topics, so make sure you go into the right folder. 

"Short Problem Topic Guides" contains the official ACSL guides for each topic that will be tested in ACSL, again organized by contest.

## Programming Section

"Programming Practice" contains programming problems from past years' competitions.

"Programming Resources" contains textbooks and guides for competitive programming. Feel free to contribute to this section.
